            <p>After an intense week of python lessons, we were tasked with creating a python-based adventure game as a way to test what we had retained from the previous week. I was grouped with other members of the coding course with varying degrees of coding experience.</p><br>
            <p>Overall, the project ran very smoothly. Teamwork and organisation were excellent which resulted in our team, Kil-A-Bytes, completing the project ahead of schedule and creating, arguably, the best game in the class.</p>

            <p>I was tasked with exploring innovative techniques of implementing Thermally-Activated Polymers (TAP) to maximise oil recovery using state-of-the-art CMG software.</p><br>
            <p>Our findings showed great promise in becoming a future implementation technique of this technology. We have been approached by CMG to aid in consulting an operator on using TAP in the field. Our results were also presented at EAGE's 21st IOR Symposium in April 2021.</p><br>
            <p>This project entailed the combined use of CMG Software (STARS, CMOST-AI, cEDIT and Results) and Excel.</p>

            <p>In the Field Development Project (FDP), students were given the opportunity to apply the knowledge acquired during the taught courses to a realistic industry problem. The project was carried out in teams of 5 or 6 students. The teams had to operate as project or asset teams, as would be the case within an oil company.</p><br>
            <p>Each team was provided with data from several wells relating to an oil discovery. A technical and economic analysis leading to development of the prospect was to be carried out, taking into account the Government’s energy and environmental policy. The conclusions were presented to Management and Government representatives for approval.</p><br>
