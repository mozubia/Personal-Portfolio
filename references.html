                        <p class="para">I came to know Mo when he started his master’s thesis under my Supervision, master thesis title “Maximising Oil Recovery Through Thermally-Activated Polymer Placement”. Due to the cross-discipline nature of the project, Mo learnt to use a number of different computer programs and analyse a considerable volume of results, which for the limitation of the MSc summer project (6.5 weeks), was an excellent achievement. Mo is well motivated, hardworking, and independent; he showed excellent analytical skills during his MSc project. Mo was very receptive to suggestions, and very pleasant for the supervisor to see that once goals were set, they were met. It was a great pleasure to be his supervisor, he excelled in the difficult circumstances during the lockdown due to the COVID-19.</p>

                        <p class="para">I worked with Mo during his thesis project during his MSc studies at Heriot Watt University. He was a greatly motivated student who took a great interest in the topic, delivered a great thesis and used his own knowledge to drive the direction of the project. He quickly took to the use of thermally activated polymers as in-depth conformance control, using cutting edge reservoir simulation software to show a optimal design (in both recovery and NPV) and suggest new methodologies for designing treatments. It was a pleasure to work with Mo for his thesis project and I am sure he will excel at his next venture as well.</p>

He managed his Design Project course with me very well, and achieved all the learning objectives of the course that encompassed all other previous components of Petroleum Engineering programme. Mo received the highest mark in the class. The overall mark constituted the combination of marks for individual report, group report and presentation.</p>

He attended also two of my courses; the second-year solid-fluid porous systems and third-year reservoir performance and simulations. Mo is a very professional hardworking student who has been very active in my course discussions and assignments. He showed the highest dedication in my class and impressed me by his great level of enthusiasm and commitment to deliver the course requirements. In the third year course, he did also a great job in MATLAB programming for basics of reservoir simulation. He is an excellent team worker and helped his peers in the tutorials of the courses. In his performance, Mo has been among top 5-10% students in my classes. I am sure wherever he works or studies, he will be outperformer!</p>
